AN ONLINE JOB PORTAL THAT USES SANITY AND REACT


The main purpose of our website is to look for the best jobs available globally from highly reputable firms.
It also offers the ability to search and filter jobs according to a user's experience or employment role.
Additionally, it contains a form that a firm user can fill out and add their job to our website.
The user or learner can then choose to save the work by clicking on the bookmark button.

A new and unexpected section has been added: the discussion chamber, which has to do with sanity (Headless CMS).
An image area has been added, where users may upload images or copy any image URL from anywhere, and the text editor will automatically preview images based on the type of input url using regex. Other features include bold, italic, and other functions.

The user can simultaneously respond with the same item.

This webpage responds fully.
